# I wonder if this is relevant:
# "This component prints the voltage as seen by the chip pin. 
# On the ESP8266, this is always 0.0V to 1.0V Some development 
# boards like the Wemos D1 mini include external voltage divider 
# circuitry to scale down a 3.3V input signal to the chip-internal 
# 1.0V. If your board has this circuitry, add a multiply filter to
# get correct values:
