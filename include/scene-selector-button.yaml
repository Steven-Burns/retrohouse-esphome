# There is an argument to be made that the below is Bad Architecture: that the division of labor should be that the device 
# simply reports events ("stimuli") and that the server Home Assistant decides how that stimuli should be interpreted.
# In that latter design, HA would have a list of scenes, a selector acting as a cursor into that list, and the logic to decide 
# when to switch between them, the device only says that a click or long click has been detected. 
# That puts the policy of environmental change only in the server.  This makes for some cool capabilities, such as a server-side 
# global lock that prevents scene changes during a dinner party by naughty children, for instance.
